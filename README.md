practise-mult
=============


Program randomly asks multiplications from 2x2 up to 12x12. In the file 'child_name.txt', the program records when it is used, the number of questions answered and how many answers are right/wrong.

I wrote this a while ago for my daughter, when she was a KS1 student (lower elementary school), so that she could do useful things, in her eyes, on a Raspberry Pi, related to school. It helped her with her times tables and also got her interested in coding!
