I wrote this a while ago for my daughter, when she was a KS1 student (lower elementary school), so that she could do useful things, in her eyes, on a Raspberry Pi, related to school. It helped her with her times tables and also got her interetsed in coding! The program records when it is used, number of questions done and how many answers are right/wrong in the file 'child_name.txt'.
